The problem we are trying to solve is creating a module in the linux /proc directory that has access to
the internal structures and attributes of the linux implementation of a process control block.

First we start with initializing with the module_init command and call the lab1_init function.
Within this function, the proc_create function is used to point to a structure that will get
us access to functions that will generate content to the file.
The function referenced is .open = lab1_open with was then used to open lab_show. This now 
allows us to gather content from the file and bring to output.

The read functions come from the lab1_fops functions. There are two routes the code may go depending
on whether the proc_ops is in action. Both fuctions do the same thing which is reading from file.
