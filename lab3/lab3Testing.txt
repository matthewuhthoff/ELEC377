Lab 3 Testing Document

we can see that after starting the program the shell is in the directory <20mau@elec377-Tues-41: ~/elec377-Tues-41/lab3>
So then when we run the ls command the resulting output is the correct printing of the directory
	Makefile  [0m[01;32mhello[0m  hello.c  [01;32mshell[0m  shell.c  test1.txt  [01;34mtester[0m
where the text encoding is a little wonky.
The added folder tester is visible and the next command is to cd into it.
After that we see the correct directory <20mau@elec377-Tues-41: ~/elec377-Tues-41/lab3/tester>
Then when we enter ls again we see the only file in this directory a testing txt file
	testing.txt
Then we return to the original directory by entering the command "cd -" which cd's to the parent directory.
Now when we run pwd we see the expected 
	/home/20mau/elec377-Tues-41/lab3
Finally to test the doProgram function we try to run the hello executable
To do this we first tried to enter the command "hello" 
This will not run however because we don't give the program any information on how to find the executable
When we instead run the command "./hello"
the program can find the executable because it starts looking in the current directory.
Then we see the output of the executable in the shell and that is also correct
	Hello 20mau
After that we test the final command "exit"
This produces the expected output
