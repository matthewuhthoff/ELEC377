Testing:
please refer to lab1_netid_out.txt for output when run from netid account and 
lab1_root_out.txt for output when run from root.

The major difference seen between the output when from as root vs netid user is the value of the UID's and GID's. 
When run as root these values are all 0, vs as netid user they are aroud 1000. Another minor difference is in the 
value of PPID, this value is higher when run as netid user (44162) compared to when run as root (36019).
