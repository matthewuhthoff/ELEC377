Documentation 2/3
    You're supposed to describe the contents of the read function (lab1_show).
Code Correctness 3/3
    You should be checking if proc_create returns NULL and returning -ENOMEM if so.
    Looks good!
Code Clarity 2/2
    You should reference TASK_RUNNING, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and TASK_STOPPED rather than hard-coding values.
Testing 2/2
    Good diversity of tests!
