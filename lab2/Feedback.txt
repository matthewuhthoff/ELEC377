Documentation 3/3


Correctness 2/3
-init_shared function needs to check if the value returned by sem_open is SEM_FAILED, not NULL, be careful and read the lab instructions!
-code does not check if semaphore post/wait fails or not

Style 2/2


Testing 1/2
-you need to include the output of your tests! TAs do not have time to run your code to validate it
-the two snippets included are helpful, but the entire log (or a significant chunk at least) is needed
