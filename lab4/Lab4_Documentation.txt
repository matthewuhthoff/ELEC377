Problem Statement:
The purpose of this lab is to write shell script to split the traces generated by lab 2. The
time span of each of the traces is then recorded at the bottom of the created file.

Describing the Lab:
First part of the lab is to extract the reader and printer traces. We first check that the
number of arguments is one and that the file exists so we know we are reading from a single
file. After we've confirmed, we use the 'grep' command to extract information with a
format and place the line into a new file. We do this for both reader and printer messages.

The second part of the lab is finding the number of machines. To do this, we used pipes to 
have the output of one program be the input of another. "cut" is used to only have the eighth
character remaining which is the monitor number. "sort" is then used to sort the numbers (figured).
"uniq" is used to only have one of each unique monitor in our case. We then use the "grep" command
similar to how we did in the first part of the lab to print lines to a new file.

The third part of this lab is finding the time range to the end of the file. Commands "head" and 
"tail" are used to get the first and last line in each file. We then find the time values using
"cut" to get the correct characters that display the time since January 1st 1970 and subtract one
from the other to find the difference (a.k.a. time range to end of file).
